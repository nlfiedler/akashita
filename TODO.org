  ** Batch Emails
    - [ ] Send email when a batch of uploads has completed, with metrics
      - Only if an email address is configured (none when testing)
      - Can also log the stats
      - Average upload time
      - Number of archives uploaded
      - Number of vaults completed
      - Capture these in the State record, using a new Metrics record
        - num archives
        - num vaults
        - total upload time

  ** Assisted Restore
    - An Escript (probably) that takes a vault name and performs the following:
      - [ ] Request an inventory of the named vault
      - [ ] Wait 4 hours
      - [ ] Retrieve inventory, map archive IDs with descriptions (to assemble the tarball)
      - [ ] Request archive retrieval for each archive
        - May need to batch the archive retrieval
        - Consider how many can be downloaded in 24 hours
      - [ ] Wait 4 hours
      - [ ] Retrieve all of the archives
      - [ ] Using the description (`filename:<vault>NNNNN`), piece the archives together
    - User will then use `tar` with the appropriate flags to extract the files.
