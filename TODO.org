* akashita TODO

  ** Shell
    - [ ] See if we can get `rebar3 shell` to start cleanly

  ** Batch Emails
    - [ ] Send email when a batch of uploads has completed, with metrics
      - Only if an email address is configured (none when testing)
      - Can also log the stats
      - Average upload time
      - Number of objects uploaded
      - Number of buckets completed
      - Capture these in the State record, using a new Metrics record
        - num objects
        - num buckets
        - total upload time

  ** Assisted Restore
    - An Escript (probably) that takes a bucket name and performs the following:
      - [ ] Retrieve all of the objects in the bucket
      - [ ] Using the object name (e.g. "photos000001"), assemble the tar file
    - User will then use `tar` with the appropriate flags to extract the files.
