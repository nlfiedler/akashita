* akashita TODO

  ** Migrate to Google Cloud Storage
    - [X] Rewrite klutlan to use Google Cloud Storage API
    - [X] Replace "klutlan" with "akashita"
    - [X] GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS must be set in env when invoking `akashita`
    - [X] Update the rebar.config for building go code
    - [X] Rename "vault" to "bucket"
    - [X] Rename "archive" to "object"
    - [ ] Consider verifying uploads by getting object attrs and comparing its MD5

  ** Batch Emails
    - [ ] Send email when a batch of uploads has completed, with metrics
      - Only if an email address is configured (none when testing)
      - Can also log the stats
      - Average upload time
      - Number of objects uploaded
      - Number of buckets completed
      - Capture these in the State record, using a new Metrics record
        - num objects
        - num buckets
        - total upload time

  ** Assisted Restore
    - An Escript (probably) that takes a bucket name and performs the following:
      - [ ] Retrieve all of the objects in the bucket
      - [ ] Using the object name (e.g. "photos000001"), assemble the tar file
    - User will then use `tar` with the appropriate flags to extract the files.
